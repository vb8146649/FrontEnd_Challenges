### What I learned

I learned of various classes in tailwind . Learned to use inbuilt as well as custom classes . Learnt to use inline css inside tailwind css

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
[using css line in the quare brackets in the tailwind css]
```
```js
colors:{
  'green-teel':'rgb_value',
}
```
this makes the custom class in tailwind to use 

### Continued development

I would try to use as much Tailwind CSS as I can to learn it as quickly as possible.

### Useful resources

- [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand tailwind. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
